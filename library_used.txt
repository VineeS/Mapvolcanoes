The libraries used here are pandas and folium
1. first using the pandas the txt file is been read 
2. Then a base layer is created using the folium and a html file
   using folium.Map ie map = folium.Map(location=[38.58,-99.09], zoom_start=6)
3. Then pandas to read a particular column ie logitude , latitude and elevation 
    for using the marker
4. Marker layer used for a pop up or circular mark for the "Volcanoes.txt"
5. polygon layer with blue boundiers for each coutries seperation
6. polygon layer used for the mark the population of each country 
7. now for the layer control that is we need to on and off the layers except for the base layer 
    by using layerControl # map.add_child(folium.LayerControl()) This would control both the layers
8. Adding Feature Grops for Volcanoes and population
